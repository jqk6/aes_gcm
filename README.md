### AES with GCM

The C implementation of AES if from <a href="https://github.com/dhuertas/AES" target="_blank">here</a><br>

GCM is from <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/documents/proposedmodes/gcm/gcm-spec.pdf" target="_blank">here</a><br>

The GCM is only for AES with 128 bits master keys.<br>

You can just change the value of <b><i>TEST_CASE</i></b>(from 1 to 5) for different test vectors.<br>
